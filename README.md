## Useful commands lines

### For managing git

For this project, we will work each of us on one separate branch and at the end we will merge our branches together 😀

Use the terminal in R studio to do that (`Tools>Terminal>New terminal`)

* `git switch -c "branchname"` create a branch and switch directly into it
* `git switch "branchname"` switch to the right branch
* `git status` to check if you are in the right branch and the commits which were already pushed in this branch

* `git add filename.R` add this file to the next commit
* `git commit -m "your commit message"` (FYI every commit needs to have a message, it's mandatory) prepare your file to be pushed
* `git push`push all the files you have commited before
