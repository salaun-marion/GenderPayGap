*Note : you can open this README into a markdown reader to get a better visualisation*

Welcome to our Shiny Application project about the Gender Pay Gap.

## Information

Few information about how the directory works :

-  `app.R`, `GenderPayGap.RProj` : don't touch to these files, they are critical for the good work of the project
-  pay_gap_Europe.csv : this is our dataset, you don't need to edit it to use the application
-  `Extra Code` directory : you will find our draft file for coding this application (like moddeling, linear correlation, train/trend try, etc ...) which are relevant according to us

## How to launch the application ?

You can open this directory on R Studio and then from the `app.R` file you have just to click on `Run App` in the right corner of the working panel. Then, enjoy !
